<!-- This layout is shared by phone and tablet in both landscape and portrait
 orientation. The purpose of having this layout is to eventually not manually
 recreate views when the orientation changes, by migrating the views that do not
 need to be recreated in onConfigurationChanged from old photo_module to this
 layout. -->
